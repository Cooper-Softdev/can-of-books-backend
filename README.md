**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
The Can of Books App is being created as a small web application to track and manage books that have impacted the us and to provide recommendations for future reading. The problem domain of this application is to help users organize and keep a record of the books that have had a significant impact on them and discover new books based on recommendations.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

## Estimates
<!-- See below -->
