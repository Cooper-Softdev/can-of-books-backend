## Overview
The Can of Books App is being created as a small web application to track and manage books that have impacted the us and to provide recommendations for future reading. The problem domain of this application is to help users organize and keep a record of the books that have had a significant impact on them and discover new books based on recommendations.

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

`npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

`npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

`npm run eject`
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Architecture
- HTML, CSS.
- JavaScript.
- React.
- Bootstrap.
- Node.js
- Axios, CORS
- MongoDB
- Netlify, Render, and Atlas for hosting.

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

19 JUN - 2:08pm
  - Live server running on Render.
  - README.MD updated, .gitignore and .JSON files added.
19 JUN - 4:30pm
  - MongoDB running and storing book objects

## Credit and Collaborations

### Logistical
- What hours will you be available to communicate?
  + Regular class hours, with extended availablility to 11pm on weekdays dependent on workload.
- What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
  + Slack and Remo.
- How often will you take breaks?
  + Mutual agreement, but no less than once per 2 hours.
- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
  + Ask for help, and put in extra hours if neccesary.

### Cooperative
- Make a list of each parson’s strengths.
  + Alex -- Backend and server side.
  + Cooper -- Frontend.
- How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
  + We can assist each other's on our own weaknesses when we get stuck or have an issue.
- In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
  + We want to increase proficiency in the other's strengths.
- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the - day-to-day development?
  + Pair programming and review/going over what we implemented that day.
 
### Conflict Resolution

- What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
  + Impossible, we're too weak to do it alone.
- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
  + We're both too introverted for that to happen.
- How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
  + Be up front about parts we are confused about or don't have full understanding of. We were both in the Army and have had soldiers we needed to take of and train with tact and professionalism. Teaching someone is a great way to learn more about it yourself.

## Time Estimates
For each of the lab features, make an estimate of the time it will take you to complete the feature, and record your start and finish times for that feature:

### Name of feature: Create backend with Render and MongoDB and route for book objects.

Estimate of time needed to complete: We forgot to estimate.

Start time: 1:45pm

Finish time: 5:20pm

Actual time needed to complete: 3hrs 35min
